<p>Nicole Boivin’s Proposal for a <a href="art_sw_eng.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:#8a2be2;">Project JEDI Software
Engineering Tool Suite Project</a> got me interested in the tools available for Delphi and in a few odd minutes I have looked around and tried a few out.</p>

<h3>FreeVCS</h3>

<p >This is a Freeware software version control system by Thomas
Hensle The version numbers are fairly complex, but
I seem to have server version 1.09 and client (Delphi Add On) version 2.2.1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>FreeVCS was donated to Project JEDI in 2002 and is actively in development now as <a href="http://jedivcs.sourceforge.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#8a2be2;"><b>JEDI VCS</b></a> under the administration of Thomas Huber. -- Ed.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would put this at the top of my list of must have Delphi
stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have been using this product
since I first read about it in Nicole’s Jedi documents.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have not tried it across the network.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It just lives on my personal machine at work
and at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have also limited my
experiments to Delphi 5 so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>FreeVCS
works great.</p>

<p>I knew what version control software was before I downloaded
FreeVCS but I had never used any.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I
hadn’t gotten a very high opinion of it from my fellows who had been forced to
use such.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They found the programs to be
a pain and just checked every file out at the beginning of a project and maybe,
if someone made them, checked them all back in at the end.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Using FreeVCS, I don’t understand what all
the fuss was about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is very easy
to use and it takes care of some jobs I was doing by hand.</p>

<p>For example, I used to try and keep a little history of the
modifications to my units up at the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I was pretty good about keeping notes in the file I was mostly working
in, but if I had changes in several files the notes never made it into everyone
of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>FreeVCS keeps track of that
and prompts me when I check the file in.</p>

<p>In the past I have occasionally broken programs while
working on them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have code saved that
won’t compile and I have no idea what I did to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Getting interrupted late on Friday afternoon is a great cause of
this problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since I have been working
with FreeVCS I haven’t made one of those bone head mistakes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I can’t prove that FreeVCS would let me
back out of it gracefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the
capability does seem to be there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I did
have one little interruption where I wasn’t sure what I had been doing when I
came back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The FreeVCS delta display
made it easy to see where I had been making changes.</p>

<p>Are there any weaknesses?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Well, I like to enter my history comments after I make the changes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>FreeVCS seems to insist on displaying the
dialog box when I check the file out as well as when I check it in.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are supposed to be able to turn that
off, but I followed the instructions and it still does it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other little gotcha I have run across is
that the FreeVCS server is really that, a TCP/IP server even when it runs
local.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My home computer is on
RoadRunner so its IP address changes every time the power goes off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I have to be careful to check the IP
address when I start the server and cut and paste the current one into the
connect to Server dialog in Delphi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The web site has a new version showing that includes support
for C++ Builder as well as Delphi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
site also has a note about using FreeVCS with Delphi 6.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I haven’t tried either of those yet.</p>

<h3>YAPP</h3>

<p>Yapp stands for yet another pretty printer, but it doesn’t
really reformat code for printing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What
it does do is convert source code to either rich text format for pasting into
Word or HTML for pasting into web documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Yapp is provided courtesy of John Kaster and you can download
it from CodeCentral at Borland.</p>

<p>I once wrote my own Pascal pretty print program to convert
Turbo Pascal code to RTF and I kept it up to date through a couple of versions
of Delphi and Word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mine worked, but
this works better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For one thing it
handles C++ and Java as well as Pascal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That is one thing I wish all the Borland helpers would do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Borland does sell, and I do use, three
different language products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shouldn’t
the tools support all three?</p>

<p>Yapp works fine for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There is an option to automatically insert the resulting RTF into your
open Word session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have that option
tuned off because it doesn’t insert, it replaces everything in your open Word
document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I lost some good work that
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the option actually inserted as
the Word Insert File... command, then I would probably use it.</p>

<p>I do have a couple of wishes for Yapp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, it doesn’t do Ada.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ok, Borland doesn’t sell an Ada compiler,
but yes I actually have gotten paid to write Ada code.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I currently use the Grasp editor to get
pretty printed Ada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Grasp, which is a
continuing computer science project from Auburn University (<a
href="http://www.eng.auburn.edu/grasp">http://www.eng.auburn.edu/grasp</a>), is
an editor that handles Ada, C++, and Java.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It can export RTF but the big deal about Grasp is that it can draw a
code structure diagram alongside the code in the editor window.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The CSD is a great idea and I wish all the
editors in the world did it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Naturally
it would be nice if Yapp did that too.</p>

<h3>CodeRush</h3>

<p>Eagle Software, Inc. (<a
href="http://www.eagle-software.com/">www.eagle-software.com</a>) sells
CodeRush as an add on to Delphi that takes the already pretty good Delphi
editor and gives it even more power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Maybe too much power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have had
CodeRush 5 standard installed for months now and I suspect I am only using a
tiny fraction of its true power.</p>

<p>CodeRush does several things I like.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First it auto-magically keeps track of the
lines I have changed in this editing session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It is sort of like having the FreeVCS diff up all the time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It lets me stick real bookmarks with names
and cute icons in the code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those help
some in finding my way around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It lets
me comment out blocks of code by inserting or removing leading //’s rather than
using (* *) surrounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It keeps track
of mismatched parentheses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I like these
features and can use them.</p>

<p>CodeRush also has a macro language and thousands of
predefined macros.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe millions of
predefined macros.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is where I get
overwhelmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The macros are not set up
exactly the way I want them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Too many
spaces here, the wrong kind of comment marker there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>With the book in hand I did manage to define a couple of my own
macros and edit some of the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
haven’t had time to edit all the macros I might want to use, and with them not
edited I don’t use them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>None of this
is a criticism of CodeRush, it’s just a lot of product.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect if I was hacking Delphi full time
I would like it more.</p>

<p>CodeRush runs fairly well, but it is not as solid as Delphi
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The popup right mouse menu is
noticeably slower to pop up with CodeRush installed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I occasionally get odd Interface not supported errors when I
start Delphi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The error dialog pops up,
I click on it, and nothing bad happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Sometimes I get protection faults when I stop Delphi and Windows warns
me it is halting the task, which is fine because I am done anyway.</p>

<p>For all the things I think CodeRush can do that I don’t know
how to use yet, there is one thing I really wish it would do that it
can’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It can’t check the spelling in
my comments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This becomes particularly
important with Doc4Delphi (see below), so I keep Word up while I’m coding and
cut and paste comments in and out, sometimes, when I think about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are some limitations in Word too.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It doesn’t know that ThisIsFourWords or
This_Is_Four_Words is really four fine words, all of them spelled
correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It puts the red wiggle under
the whole thing.</p>

<h3>Doc4Delphi</h3>

<p>This is a Delphi version of JavaDoc provided to the world by
User Driven Software, Ltd. (<a href="http://www.udsl.com/">www.udsl.com</a>).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can download the Beta test version from
the CodeCentral at Borland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have only
recently spent some time learning Java so javaDoc was new to me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh, what a wonderful idea, I thought, I wonder
if anyone has built anything like that for Delphi?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And here it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p>Doc4Delphi produces HTML documentation by reading your
source code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It can get the basic
structure with no special help from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, if you want real helpful documents you do have to insert HTML
into comments in the code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Which of
course is why I want an editor that spell checks comments.</p>

<p>Doc4Delphi works fairly well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The documents look very much like what javaDoc generates.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe it uses the same cascading style
sheets?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have managed to break it on
code with overloaded procedure names.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It doesn’t support the special @ constructs that javaDoc uses, but that
isn’t a major problem for a first effort.</p>

<p>The interface for Doc4Delphi is rather cryptic although I
have managed to make it work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What I
would prefer is just one menu item in the Delphi IDE that generates (or
updates) the HTML files for the current project.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Of course that would require parsing the project file and walking
the tree of uses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Doc4Delphi doesn’t do
that yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is strictly a one Pascal
file at a time critter.</p>

<p>One of the weaknesses I noticed in the javaDoc generated
documents that ship with JBuilder is that they lack the many examples we Delphi
folks are used to having in our on-line help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It might be possible to use yapp in conjunction with Doc4Delphi to
include syntax highlighted examples in your documents.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I tried it once and made a mess.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What would be really nice would be something
like an @see construct that points to an example.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Then our Delphi classes would quickly outclass the Java classes
because they would all have examples.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So I found four Delphi tools that I think are
worthwhile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What else is out
there?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does anyone want to add his or
her discoveries to this list?</p>
