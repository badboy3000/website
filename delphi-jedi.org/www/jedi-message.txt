We lost the hard drive for the server that JEDI is hosted on in December 2002. 
We are working on rebuilding from backups, etc. and will try to keep you updated 
here with more news as we have it.

In the meantime, please go to 

   http://projectjedi.sourceforge.net 

for links to project items that are located there or at other external sites.
