<p>Often, when a user starts using your new program,
he needs assistance to step him through &quot;how-to&quot; do
different operations. As experience grows, less structured help
is required. Quick and appropriate information can be helpful.
So - where can this information be stored, and how is it displayed?</p>

<P>As a Delphi programmer, you are in luck. Most
visual controls, being descendants of TControl, have a Hint property,
that can be set to display a little &quot;balloon&quot; of brief
help to inform or remind your user about the control. </p>

<P>To implement a control's Hint property, select
the control, press F11 for the Object Inspector, select the Hint
property and type in the text. Repeat this step until all desired
controls have hints assigned. </p>

<P>One last thing is required. Select the form,
go to ShowHint property in the Object Inspector and set it to
True. Now fire up the application, position the mouse over each
control to see the hint assigned to it. </p>

<P>Notice that hints display for only a short
time. You can change the length of time hints display in your
application, by setting a new value for the global HintHidePause
property: </p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
Application.HintHidePause := 10000;</pre></FONT></P>

<p>The example above shows all hints for approximately
ten seconds, much longer than the half second default timeout.</p>

<h3>Another Hint about Hints</h3>

<P>Besides showing hints over controls, you can
show them in another location, such as a StatusBar. Simply enter
the hint as before but add a <i>pipe symbol</i>: </p>

<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
Button1.Hint := 'This is shown over the button|This is redirected to a status-bar';</pre></FONT></P>

<p>NOTE: The text on the left of the pipe symbol
is referred to as <I>ShortHint</I> and to the right of the pipe
symbol is called <I>LongHint.</I> </p>

<h3>Steps to display LongHint</h3>

<p>(nothing changes for ShortHint)</p>
<OL>

<LI>Add a StatusBar to the main form.<BR></li>

<LI><p>Manually add the following code to the private section of the form's interface:</p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
<b>procedure</B> AppOnHint(Sender: TObject); </pre></FONT></P></li>

<LI><p>Double click the form, and place this code in the OnCreate event: </p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
StatusBar1.SimplePanel := True;
<FONT COLOR=#000080>// but set this False if you want to use panels.</font>
Application.OnHint := AppOnHint; <FONT COLOR=#000080>// specifies an event to trigger
when OnHint is fired. </font> </pre></FONT></P></li>

<LI><p>Add the following procedure to your code: </p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
<b>procedure</FONT></B>
TfrmMain.AppOnHint;
<B>begin</B>
  Statusbar1.SimpleText := Application.Hint; 
<B>end</B>; </pre></FONT></P>

<p>This code takes the LongHint and places it into the StatusBar. Most of the time this works
fine, but it has limitations which we will examine shortly. </p></li>

<LI>As the mouse cursor moves over any controls which have long hints assigned to them,
you should see hints. (Note: short hints will not display unless
you set the form's property ShowHint to True.) </li>
</OL>

<h3>Hints on Child Forms</h3>

<P>Now that you understand how to show hints
for the main form of a project, lets move onto showing hints on
child forms. I feel it is rude to make users look for long hints
in the main forms status-bar while on a child form. To rectify
this, a few code additions are needed to the original code for
the main form and we need to add status bars to each child form.</p>

<P>First, change the code for the procedure AppOnHintto read: </p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
TStatusBar(Screen.ActiveForm.FindComponent('Statusbar1')).SimpleText:= Application.Hint; </pre></font></p>

<blockquote>
<P>When the application's OnHint event fires,
it triggers AppOnHint. The code within AppOnHint locates StatusBar1
using FindComponent, then typecasts it as TStatusBar. Next the
current control's long hint is assigned to StatusBar1's SimpleText
property, on the current form. </p>
</blockquote>

<P>Next, add a StatusBar to each form, setting
SimplePanel to True. Run the application and you will see hints
displayed on the status-bar of any form that is current. </p>

<h4>Caveat</h4>
<p>This code works 99% of the time. An error will occur if you forget to include a statusbar on a form
or you are using a third-party message box which is actually a descendant of TCustomForm. Probably a GPF will occur and you will blame that third party control. </p>

<P>In fact, it is the code for showing hints that is the culprit here, but you can prevent the access violation
very simply by testing for the presence of the statusbar. Change the code to: </p>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
<b>procedure</FONT></B> TfrmMain.AppOnHint;
<B>var</B>
T: TComponent;<BR>
<B>begin</B>
  T := Screen.ActiveForm.FindComponent('Statusbar1');
  <B>if</B> T &lt;&gt; <B>nil then</B>
    TStatusBar(T).SimpleText := Application.Hint;
  <B>end</B>;
<B>end</B></pre></font></p>

<P>Now, when the active form has no component named StatusBar1, no GPF!</p>

<h3>A Couple of Tips</h3>

<P>Tip 1: Menu items can display hints as described above, i.e. in a StatusBar</p>
<P>

<p>Tip 2: Short hints can be displayed in multi-line format. For example </p>

<P><FONT face="Courier New"><pre>
Button1.Hint := 'Pretty cool'#13'You can have multi-line hints|Of course not long hints'; </pre></font></p>

<P>The above example would show a short hint with two (2) lines of text in a Hint balloon, while the long hint
remains a one-liner. </p>

<P align="center">Well, that should be enough to get you started - have fun! </p>
