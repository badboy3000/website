<H4>Project JEDI Alliance</H4><br>

<p>
Recently a number of people have approached Project JEDI, 
interested in having their projects become part of JEDI.
</p>

<p>
After discussion on the Steering Team, we developed some guidelines.
We hope they will be helpful to any existing Open Source projects that would like to be associated with JEDI. As always, 
<A href="mailto:director@delphi-jedi.org?Subject=Re: JEDI Alliance">feedback</A> 
from the field would be very much appreciated.<BR>  
</P>

Three categories of projects are associated with Project JEDI: 
<UL type=square>
<LI>Open Source project (listed on JEDI Portal) </LI>
<LI>Member of JEDI Alliance</LI>
<LI>JEDI Project (e.g. JVCL, JCL, Darth, JEDI-VCS) </LI>
</UL>
<p>
In more detail: 
</p>
<B>OpenSource project listed on JEDI Portal</B>
<P>
We provide a link on our Website to OpenSource projects that we believe provide a benefit to Delphi community. In return we request that our “Project JEDI Now” logo<BR><IMG height=31 alt="JEDI Now button" 
src="http:\\homepages.borland.com\jedi\images\btn_jedinow.gif" width=116 border=0> <BR>
is present on the project’s Website. The advantage is that both sides provide visibility to each other.
</P>
<P>The project is totally independent from JEDI.
