<h1 align=center>News portal</h1>

<p>Version 0.24pre4</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>News portal is a PHP based newsreader.  It is licensed under the GNU
Public License (see enclosed LICENSE).
</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This script collection enables the access to a newsserver (by NNTP) from
a webpage. It allows you to combine web-forums and newsgroups.
The script is also suitable for presentation of announce newsgroups
on web pages, without having the user notice that he is in fact accessing a newsserver.
</p>

<p>The main functionality of the script is located in the file
<tt>newsportal.php</tt>, which contains the major part of the implemented php3-functions.
In addition to that there are four more php3-files, which are directly accessed
by the browser:</p>
<UL>
<li><i>index.php</i>  shows the available newsgroups of the newsserver (if
you have added the names to groups.txt)
<li><i>thread.php </i>displays the article-overview of a newsgroup. The
articles are displayed in a thread.
<li><i>article.php</i> displays an individual article.
<li><i>post.php</i> posts a message into a newsgroup. 
<li><i>attachment.php</i> shows possible attachments of articles.
</UL>

<p>There are some more files that control the behavior of newsportal or
contain information:</p>
<UL>
<li><i>config.inc </i> contains the configuration.
<li><i>head.inc</i> contains the header and the body-tag of the pages. This way
the layout of the pages (i.e. the background) can easily be adjusted.
<li><i>tail.inc</i> contains the end of every page.
<li><i>german.lang </i>:  The German language definitions
<li><i>english.lang </i>:  The English language definitions
</ul></p>

<p>Since fetching the article overview of the newsserver takes quite some time,
newsportal caches this data in the directory
<tt>spool/</tt>. Any file can be put in this directory, they will
automatically be regenerated.
</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<p><ol>
<li>download the zip or tar.gz archive
<li>unzip it to a directory

<li>The file<tt>config.inc</tt> 
must be edited with your settings (the most important variables are:
<i>$server, $port, $title and $readonly</i>).

<li>Write the names of all groups newsportal should show into the file <tt>groups.txt</tt>.
Behind the groupname, seperated by a blank, a description of the group can be added. If the description is missing,
newsportal will try to request the description from the newsserver.

<li>The spool directory has to be created and configured to grant read an write access to the newsserver
("chmod 777 spool" ).

<li>Adjust the Codepage in head.inc. If you are in western europe or the USA
the predefined iso-8859-1 is correct and you don't have to change it.
</ol></p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The following adjustments can be made in <tt>config.inc</tt>
</p>

<p><b>Directories and files:</b>
<UL>
<li><i>$file_newsportal="newsportal.php":</i>Name of the file containing
the newsportal-functions.
<li><i>$file_groups="index.php"</i>: The file which shows the list of
available newsgroups.
<li><i>$file_thread="thread.php"</i>: The file which shows the
article-thread of a selected newsgroup
<li><i>$file_article="article.php"</i>: Displays an article
<li><i>$file_post="post.php"</i>: The file which allows you to post an
article to a newsgroup. This file can be removed, if the system is set on
readonly (see below).
<li><i>$file_language="english.lang"</i>:  Reference to the language
definition file.
<li><i>$file_footer</i>: Optionally, the name of a file can
be indicated, which will be attached to every article posted to a newsgroup.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Newsserver setip</b>
<UL>
<li><i>$server </i>: Hostname or IP of the newsserver
<li><i>$port </i>: Port of the newsserver, normally 119
<li><i>$post_server</i>: Optionally an extra newsserver can be indicated here
which is used by post.php3 for writing articles. 
This is useful if two newsservers need to be accessed, a fast read-only server and a slow server
to post articles. Be aware that it might take some time until the posted article will show up on your
main newsserver ($server), which you use to read articles.
<li><i>$post_port </i>: Port of your post-newsserver
<li><i>$server_auth_user</i>: If the newsserver requires authentication by name and password put your username
here. Otherwise just set the variable to "".
<li><i>$server_auth_pass</i>: Put your password here.
</ul></p>

<p><b>Thread Layout</b>
<ul>
<li><i>$treestyle </i>:The appearance of the message tree:
<ul>
 <li>0: Simple listing of the articles</li>
 <li>1: Easy listing of the articles, with some more HTML tags</li>
 <li>2: Simple listing in a table</li>
 <li>3: Threaded with HTML-tags (UL, li)</li>
 <li>4: Threaded with text characters</li>
 <li>5: Threaded with graphical images</li>
 <li>6: Threaded with text characters and table</li>
 <li>7: Threaded with graphical images table</li>
</ul></li>

<li><i>$thread_fontPre</i>: The code given here is put in front of every text fragment in thread.php3, i.e.
font face or size can be set.</li>
<li><i>$thread_fontPost</i>: The same as $thread_fontPre,
only code is appended at the end of the text.</li>

<li><i>$thread_showDate,<br>
       $thread_showSubject,<br>
       $thread_showAuthor</i>:
<ul>
 <li>true: the date / the subject / the author are displayed in
     the thread</li>
 <li>false: output is suppressed.</li>
</ul>

<li><i>$thread_maxSubject </i>: Maximum number of characters of the subject displayed</li>
<li><i>$maxarticles</i>: This number indicates the maximum amount of
overview data of a newsgroup newsportal tries to get from the newsserver.
"0" means no limitation. $maxarticles also indicates the amount of articles
to be stored in the spoolfiles. A lower value means less work for newsportal</li>
<li><i>$maxarticles_extra</i>: The problem with $maxarticles is that all
article data must be completely requested again by the new server, if the
indicated value is exceeded.
$maxarticles_extra can be set to prevent this.
The article-spool will only be restructured if
$maxarticles + $maxarticles_extra articles are present, whereby
$maxarticles many article data are requested. 
Only if an exact given number of articles should be displayed on the web page, the value of
this variable schould be set "0".</li>
<li><i>$age_count </i>: Number of different age levels for the
coloured marking of articles</li>
<li><i>$$age_time[n] </i>: maximal age of an article in seconds,
so that the article gets marked with the colour $age_color[n].
n is a natural number &gt; = 1 and all numbers from 1 to n must be
assigned, gaps are not permitted.</li>
<li><i>$age_color[n]</i>: The colour in which the article is marked</li>
<li><i>$thread_sorting </i>: The sort sequence for the articles:
<ul>
 <li>0: No assortment, articles are displayed in the order in which they are polled from
	  the server. This is nearly like ascending
        assortment.</li>
<li> 1: ascending assortment, the oldest articles to the top.</li>
<li> -1: descending assortment, the newest articles to the top.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>$articles_per_page</i>: If this value is not 0, the maximum amount of articles is given, which are to be
displayed on one page at the same time. The thread will be split into
individual pages.</li>
<li><i>$startpage</i>: In connection with $$articles_per_page
the variable indicates, which page is to be displayed first:
<ul>
  <li>"first": The page with the newest articles</li>
  <li>"last":  the page with the oldest articles</li>
</ul>
The specification should be co-ordinated with <i>$thread_sorting</i>.
"first" for 0 and 1, and "last" for -1.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Article layout</b>
<ul>
<li><i>$article_show["Subject"],<br>
       $article_show["From"],<br>
       $article_show["Newsgroups"],<br>
       $article_show["Organization"],<br>
       $article_show["Date"],<br>
       $article_show["Message-ID"],<br>
       $article_show["User-Agent"],<br>
       $article_show["References"]</i>:
"true" displays the
respective header line in article.php3, by "false" it
is suppressed.</ul></p>

<p><b>Frame support</b><br>
Example files for the frame support are located in
<tt>extras/frames/</tt>. In this section the names of the frames can be
defined. If you want to use frames you have to set the variable
$frame_thread to "thread_frameset.php3".
<ul>
<li><i>$frame_articles</i>: Name of the article frame. Must be the same as
defined in <tt> thread_frameset.php3</tt>.</li>
<li>$frame_thread</i>:  Name of the thread frame.
<li><i>$frame_groups</i>: Name of the frame for the grouplist, normally set
to "_top" to open a new frameset.</li>
<li><i>$frame_post </i>: Name of the frame for post.php3</li>
<li><i>$frame_threadframeset </i>: Name of the frame, in which the
frameset is to appear, which takes up the article and thread Frames.
Normally set to "_top".</li>
<li><i>$frame_externallink</i>: Target frame for external links within
articles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Safety settings</b>
<ul>
<li><i>$send_poster_host</i>: "true" means that a header-line named "X-HTTP-Posting-Host:"
will be attached to every posted article, set to the hostname of the user who wrote the article.</li>
<li><i>$readonly </i>: if set to "true", the newsportal is read-only. The file post.php3 can be safely removed.</li>
<li><i>$testgroup </i>: if set to "true" newsportal checks if a group is
listed in <tt>groups.txt</tt> when accessed through thread.php3.
Otherwise a group could be seen simply entering the right URL, although
the group is not displayed in the group list.</li>
<li><i>$validate_email </i>: Sets how newsportal checks an
email address in post.php3 for syntax:
<ul>
 <li>0: no examination.  Not recommended, since the
newsserver will give an error message, if the address is not syntactically
correct.</li>
 <li>1:  Checks the address on syntactic correctness.</li>
 <li>2:  Additionally a MX or A record is checked for the domain-name of the e-mail address.
	Newsportal performs a hostname lookup.</li>
</ul>
</UL></p>

<p><b>General setting</b>
<UL>
<li><i>$title</i>: The value of this variable is put in the title-header of
the generated webpages.</li>
<li><i>$organization </i>: Name of your organization. Put after the
"Organization:"-header when posting articles.</li>
<li><i>$setcookies </i>: Permits the user to save his name and his
email-address as cookies in his browser.</li>
<li><i>$compress_spoolfiles</i>:  Sets whether the spool files should be compressed or not.
This is recommended under normal conditions, since the size of the spoolfiles shrinks 
approximately to about 15% of the original size. Be aware that some PHP-Versions
do not support compressing
</UL></p>

<h2>Safety notes</h2>

<p>A few things must be kept in mind to not allow newsportal to open 
safety-holes:
<ul>
<li><tt>config.inc</tt> can be requested by every user that knows the filename,
if you do not move it to a protected area of your webserver.
</ul></p>

<p>This script was originally (and actually still) only meant
for access to local newsgroups. If you use it with UseNet newsgroups,
following problems could show up:
<ul>
<li>Articles could be posted anonymously (i.e. spamming), see $send_poster_host</li>
<li>Newsportal produces 8-bit header lines (i.e. the Subject),
which is not permitted.  However there do not seem to be any problems.</li>
<li>There are lists with so-called "open" newsservers in the
internet. Mostly "open" doesn't mean for this server that everyone is
allowed to use this server. Normally it means that the operator of the server
forgot to protect his server adequatly. So before using an "open" newsserver,
you should make sure that the operator permits the use of his
server for newsportal.</li>
<li>Posting articles anonymously is not accepted in most UseNet groups. 
Before you give writing access to a newsgroup, you should ask the users in the newsgroup
if they have no objections. <b>Do not give public write access on UseNet newsgroups,
if you do not know exactly, what you are doing!</b></li>
</ul></p>

Liability claims regarding damage caused by the program provided, will therefore be rejected.<br>
In other words: Use this program at your own risk !</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Newsportal should work with every phpserver with php3 support
and every newsserver. Webserver and newsserver do not need to run on the
same machine.</p>
